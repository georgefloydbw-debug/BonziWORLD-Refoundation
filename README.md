## Are there notable differences?
Yes, there are.

* **Original**:
* * **Unedited:** Joseph Judge was the only creator of the original BonziWORLD. Pretty cool huh? Original BonziWORLD features black/brown/red/green/blue/purple/pink/pope bonzis, with some commands.
  * **Modified:** The original BonziWORLD 2 was currently abandoned by Seamus. I understand why he created it but then later took it down due to kiddies back in 2020. There are also more bonzis: magenta, yellow, emerald, diamond and orange.
* **Replica**: Kind of, accurately done by me via creating bonzis with Paint.NET and usually replacing original BZW images with modified BZW images or literal shit.
