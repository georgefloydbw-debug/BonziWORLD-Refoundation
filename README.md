## Website Rules/Guidelines

I expect these users to read the rules for the website in this readme md file on my github respiratory.
- **Do not raid this site**. Raiding can literally cause the service to get unhealthy on onrender.com, but then, if you have been caught, you can get you kicked, or banned immediately.
- **No NSFW content allowed**. It is prohibited. This includes pornography. Punishment: Banned. Otherwise kicked.
- **No flooding**. Flood only in the room ID: "flood-room". If you have been caught flooding in public room, punishment: Banned.
- **No spamming unless it is okay**. Punishments: either muted, kicked or banned
- **No leaking the godword**. Doing this will immediately result in a different godmode password. Punishment: Kicked/Banned

Violation of these rules/guidelines will result in a mute, a kick and/or a ban.
