#                            BonziWORLD Refoundation                                                                                                                                                        
All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run a fork of my replica BonziWORLD 2, by all means go ahead.
Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Special Thanks To:

- Joseph Judge (original; he was known as the creator of the original BonziWORLD)
- Seamus (original creator of BW2; creator of bonkey.world (dead)/BWCE (bloated shitty server) (indefinitely dead))
- Fune 720 (i guess i gave him special thanks after the war ended; creator of BonziWORLD.org)
- DonutScout (Maxwell Finch) (i think)
- gir (maybe)
- earthbound/scumbag (i guess)
- marco (i think)


## Are there notable differences?
Yes, there are.

* **Original**:
* * **Unedited:** Joseph Judge was the only creator of the original BonziWORLD. Pretty cool huh? Original BonziWORLD features black/brown/red/green/blue/purple/pink/pope bonzis, with some commands.
  * **Modified:** The original BonziWORLD 2 was currently abandoned by Seamus. I understand why he created it but then later took it down due to kiddies back in 2020. There are also more bonzis: magenta, yellow, emerald, diamond and orange.
* **Replica**: Kind of, accurately done by me via creating bonzis with Paint.NET and usually replacing original BZW images with modified BZW images or literal shit.
